    <h1 class="content__headline">Built-in template: multiple&nbsp;content&nbsp;lock</h1>
    <p class="content__text">A built-in inline template can also be used to lock content. Unlike a modal, it still shows an article, but only its very beginning (for example, first 2 paragraphs). For a more teasing effect, a fade-out strip can be added at the top of a template to highlight that the content is there but a user cannot access it until they sign up or, say, buy a subscription.</p>
    <p class="content__text">One variety of a content lock is a multiple content lock. Instead of unlocking the whole article after a user performs an action we need, we show them another couple of paragraphs locking the rest of the content with another content lock template. You may add as many iterations like this as you want.</p>
    <p class="content__text">Of course we don’t ask a user to register or buy a subscription every time. We’d rather replace a "Subscribe" button with a “Read further” button which would simply dismiss a current template and unlock another portion of an article, persistently reminding of subscription options, or a special deal, or whatever you want. Or we could let them, for instance, click a “Read further” button for the first two times, and on the third time lock the rest of the content completely leaving only a “Subscribe” button with no option to read&nbsp;more.</p>
    <p class="content__action">
      <a class="content__button button unbutton" href="multi-content-lock-demo.html">Demo</a>
      <span class="content__footnote">To return from the demo page, please use the browser Back button. We were trying to make the demo as close to real life as possible, and did not provide any link to go back intentionally.</span>

    <h3 class="content__small-headline content__small-headline--secondary" id="set-up-a-template">Setting up a template</h3>
    <p class="content__text">
      We need to set up an inline template using <a class="content__link link" href="https://docs.piano.io/actions/#templatetab" target="_blank">Composer</a>. More information on this you will find in our documentation, in the links just mentioned. Please pay attention to an inline type of templates.
    </p>
    <h3 class="content__small-headline content__small-headline--secondary" id="hide-content">Hiding content with fade-out effect</h3>
    <p class="content__text">Prepare an empty container for an inline template. Let's say it has a class <code class="content__code">.piano-container</code>. Once it's ready, just put it between paragraphs, or where you want your users to see templates, as many times as you want to lock the content. Mind to use a CSS class as an identifier for a Composer experience, not an ID, since we need to populate a template to several containers at the same time. But we'll still be able to see only the first one, as long as it is not dismissed, due to CSS code we're going to provide.</p>
    <p class="content__text">When specifying the container in Composer, you should also add an Apply CSS card to assign another class <code class="content__code">piano-container--active</code> to it. This is necessary to hide the content only when experience is running.</p>
    <p class="content__text">The most lightweight way to hide your content is to put a Piano container with a template in it on the same level as all your paragraphs within an article. Then a few lines of CSS code can do the trick and make all elements after the container invisible, like this:</p>
    <pre class="content__code">
    .piano-container--active:not(:empty) ~ * {
      display: none;
    }</pre>
    <p class="content__text">Here and further, we add a <code class="content__code">:not(:empty)</code> selector. We need it because when a user clicks "Read further", the template is being dismissed and removed from its container. It becomes empty. Using CSS we make it show what's going after it, but only until we meet the next Piano container.</p>
    <p class="content__text">To add a fade-out effect all you want to do is to describe it in your CSS as a pseudo-element, here is an example code:</p>
    <pre class="content__code">
    .piano-container--active {
      position: relative;
    }

    .piano-container--active:not(:empty)::before {
      content: "";
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 100%;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      height: 200px;
      background-image: linear-gradient(
        to top,
        #ffffff 0%,
        #ffffff 20%,
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 100%
      );
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="content__text">You can modify this strip however you like, for example adjust its height or transparency.</p>
    <h3 class="content__small-headline content__small-headline--secondary" id="specify-sizes">Specifying a template size</h3>
    <p class="content__text">Piano inline templates simply take 100% of a parent container width. By the parent container we mean that <code class="content__code">&lt;div&gt;</code> you specify on your end for Piano template to show up. Regarding its height, the browser counts it automatically according to the template contents. So nothing needs to be defined. Oppositely, please, let Piano template be parsed freely&nbsp;&mdash; things like setting up a fixed height would prevent it from displaying correctly.</p>
